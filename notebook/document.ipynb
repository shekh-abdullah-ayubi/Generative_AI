    "The Path to Karbala\n",
    "The saga began with the death of the first Umayyad Caliph, Muawiya I, in 680 CE.\n",
    "In an unprecedented move, Muawiya had designated his son Yazid as his successor.\n",
    "This hereditary transfer of power was a departure from Islamic tradition and was met with widespread opposition.\n",
    "Among the most prominent dissidents were Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr.\n",
    "Yazid, upon assuming the caliphate, demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.\n",
    "Husayn, upholding the principles of Islam, refused to acknowledge Yazid, whom he considered corrupt and tyrannical.\n",
    "Seeking to avoid bloodshed in holy sites, Husayn left Medina and traveled to Mecca.\n",
    "While in Mecca, he received numerous letters from the people of Kufa, in Iraq, pledging their loyalty and support.\n",
    "The Kufans invited Husayn to their city to lead a rebellion against Umayyad rule.\n",
    "Husayn, convinced of the justness of his cause, decided to travel to Kufa.\n",
    "He dispatched his cousin, Muslim ibn Aqil, ahead to Kufa to assess the situation and rally support.\n",
    "Initially, Ibn Aqil garnered significant support in Kufa.\n",
    "However, Yazids appointment of a new, ruthless governor, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, changed the tide.\n",
    "Ibn Ziyad brutally suppressed the pro-Husayn movement, capturing and executing Muslim ibn Aqil.\n",
    "Husayn, unaware of the tragic turn of events in Kufa, proceeded with his family and a small group of companions.\n",
    "His journey took him through the desert, where his caravan was intercepted by an Umayyad vanguard led by al-Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi.\n",
    "Hurr, acting under Ibn Ziyads orders, prevented Husayn from entering Kufa.\n",
    "The caravan was eventually forced to camp in a desolate plain known as Karbala on the second day of Muharram, 61 AH (October 2, 680 CE).\n",
    "The Standoff in Karbala\n",
    "Over the next few days, a much larger Umayyad army, commanded by Umar ibn Sad, arrived in Karbala.\n",
    "The Umayyad army, vastly outnumbering Husayns small band, surrounded the camp.\n",
    "On the seventh of Muharram, Ibn Sad cut off Husayns camp from access to the Euphrates River.\n",
    "The lack of water began to take a severe toll on Husayns family and companions, including women and children.\n",
    "Negotiations for a peaceful resolution failed, as Husayn refused to compromise his principles or pledge allegiance to Yazid.\n",
    "Husayn and his followers spent the night of the ninth of Muharram praying and preparing for the inevitable.\n",
    "He offered his companions a chance to leave under the cover of darkness, but they all chose to stay and fight alongside him.\n",
    "The Day of Ashura (10th of Muharram)\n",
    "On the morning of the tenth of Muharram (October 10, 680 CE), the battle began.\n",
    "Husayns small group of around 72 combatants faced an Umayyad army estimated to be thousands strong.\n",
    "Before the fighting, Husayn gave a final speech, reminding the Umayyad soldiers of his status as the Prophets grandson.\n",
    "His words prompted Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi, the initial Umayyad commander, to defect and join Husayns side.\n",
    "The battle proceeded with a series of duels and small skirmishes, showcasing the bravery and faith of Husayns followers.\n",
    "One by one, the companions of Husayn fought valiantly and were martyred.\n",
    "Among the first to fall was Habib ibn Muzahir, a revered elder companion.\n",
    "Then, many of Husayns own family members, including his sons, nephews, and half-brothers, entered the battlefield.\n",
    "His eldest son, Ali Akbar, was killed after a heroic fight.\n",
    "The standard-bearer of Husayns camp, his half-brother Abbas ibn Ali, attempted to reach the river for water.\n",
    "He fought bravely but was surrounded, had his arms cut off, and was killed before he could return with water.\n",
    "The thirst and exhaustion of Husayns group worsened, yet their resolve did not falter.\n",
    "In a heart-wrenching moment, Husayn held his six-month-old son, Ali Asghar, and appealed for water for the infant.\n",
    "Instead, a soldier from the Umayyad army shot an arrow, killing the baby instantly.\n",
    "Husayn, devastated, smeared the infants blood on his face, calling out to God as a witness.\n",
    "As the last of his companions and family fell, Husayn stood alone on the battlefield.\n",
    "Despite his wounds and fatigue, he fought fiercely, refusing to surrender.\n",
    "His resistance was met with a final brutal assault by the Umayyad soldiers.\n",
    "He was eventually struck down and beheaded by an attacker named Sinan ibn Anas and Shimr ibn Ziljawshan.\n",
    "His body, along with those of his companions, was mutilated and trampled by horses on the orders of Ibn Ziyad.\n",
    "The Umayyad army had won the battle, but the martyrdom of Husayn forever condemned Yazid in the eyes of many Muslims.\n",
    "The Aftermath\n",
    "The surviving women and children of Husayns family were taken captive.\n",
    "They were paraded through the streets of Kufa and Damascus as prisoners.\n",
    "Husayns sister, Zaynab, courageously delivered powerful sermons, condemning the tyranny of Yazid and his regime.\n",
    "Yazid, in a public display, feigned remorse and blamed Ibn Ziyad for the massacre, though historians believe this was a hypocritical act to deflect responsibility.\n",
    "The events of Karbala served as a major catalyst for the split between Sunni and Shia Islam.\n",
    "For Shia Muslims, Husayns sacrifice at Karbala became the ultimate symbol of resistance against oppression and the struggle for justice.\n",
    "The tenth of Muharram, known as Ashura, is observed by Shia Muslims worldwide as a day of mourning and reflection on the tragedy.\n",
    "The story of Karbala has since inspired countless poets, artists, and revolutionaries, and it remains a central and defining event in Islamic history.\n",

Ziyad brutally suppressed the pro-Husayn movement, capturing and executing Muslim ibn Aqil.\\nHusayn, unaware of the tragic turn of events in Kufa, proceeded with his family and a small group of companions.\\nHis journey took him through the desert, where his caravan was intercepted by an Umayyad vanguard led by al-Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi.\\nHurr, acting under Ibn Ziyads orders, prevented Husayn from entering Kufa.\\nThe caravan was eventually forced to camp in a desolate plain known as Karbala on the second day of Muharram, 61 AH (October 2, 680 CE).\\nThe Standoff in Karbala\\nOver the next few days, a much larger Umayyad army, commanded by Umar ibn Sad, arrived in Karbala.\\nThe Umayyad army, vastly outnumbering Husayns small band, surrounded the camp.\\nOn the seventh of Muharram, Ibn Sad cut off Husayns camp from access to the Euphrates River.\\nThe lack of water began to take a severe toll on Husayns family and companions, including women and children.\\nNegotiations for a peaceful resolution failed, as Husayn refused to compromise his principles or pledge allegiance to Yazid.\\nHusayn and his followers spent the night of the ninth of Muharram praying and preparing for the inevitable.\\nHe offered his companions a chance to leave under the cover of darkness, but they all chose to stay and fight alongside him.\\nThe Day of Ashura (10th of Muharram)\\nOn the morning of the tenth of Muharram (October 10, 680 CE), the battle began.\\nHusayns small group of around 72 combatants faced an Umayyad army estimated to be thousands strong.\\nBefore the fighting, Husayn gave a final speech, reminding the Umayyad soldiers of his status as the Prophets grandson.\\nHis words prompted Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi, the initial Umayyad commander, to defect and join Husayns side.\\nThe battle proceeded with a series of duels and small skirmishes, showcasing the bravery and faith of Husayns followers.\\nOne by one, the companions of Husayn fought valiantly and were martyred.\\nAmong the first to fall was Habib ibn Muzahir, a revered elder companion.\\nThen, many of Husayns own family members, including his sons, nephews, and half-brothers, entered the battlefield.\\nHis eldest son, Ali Akbar, was killed after a heroic fight.\\nThe standard-bearer of Husayns camp, his half-brother Abbas ibn Ali, attempted to reach the river for water.\\nHe fought bravely but was surrounded, had his arms cut off, and was killed before he could return with water.\\nThe thirst and exhaustion of Husayns group worsened, yet their resolve did not falter.\\nIn a heart-wrenching moment, Husayn held his six-month-old son, Ali Asghar, and appealed for water for the infant.\\nInstead, a soldier from the Umayyad army shot an arrow, killing the baby instantly.\\nHusayn, devastated, smeared the infants blood on his face, calling out to God as a witness.\\nAs the last of his companions and family fell, Husayn stood alone on the battlefield.\\nDespite his wounds and fatigue, he fought fiercely, refusing to surrender.\\nHis resistance was met with a final brutal assault by the Umayyad soldiers.\\nHe was eventually struck down and beheaded by an attacker named Sinan ibn Anas and Shimr ibn Ziljawshan.\\nHis body, along with those of his companions, was mutilated and trampled by horses on the orders of Ibn Ziyad.\\nThe Umayyad army had won the battle, but the martyrdom of Husayn forever condemned Yazid in the eyes of many Muslims.\\nThe Aftermath\\nThe surviving women and children of Husayns family were taken captive.\\nThey were paraded through the streets of Kufa and Damascus as prisoners.\\nHusayns sister, Zaynab, courageously delivered powerful sermons, condemning the tyranny of Yazid and his regime.\\nYazid, in a public display, feigned remorse and blamed Ibn Ziyad for the massacre, though historians believe this was a hypocritical act to deflect responsibility.\\nThe events of Karbala served as a major catalyst for the split between Sunni and Shia Islam.\\nFor Shia Muslims, Husayns sacrifice at Karbala became the ultimate symbol of resistance against oppression and the struggle for justice.\\nThe tenth of Muharram, known as Ashura, is observed by Shia Muslims worldwide as a day of mourning and reflection on the tragedy.\\nThe story of Karbala has since inspired countless poets, artists, and revolutionaries, and it remains a central and defining event in Islamic history.\\n')]"

The \\nnuisance of an indecent sin had caused constant back pain that was \\nnot cured despite every medical treatment. \\nFortunately, some Islamic brothers, who were acquainted with me \\ninsisted me that I join them in the collective I’tikāf in the Ramadan of \\n1426 A.H. (2005). At first, I refused but they insisted and so I had to \\nsay ‘yes’. I became a Mu’takif for the last ten days of Ramaḍān (1426) \\nwith devotees of Prophet in Memon Masjid (‘Aṭṭārabād).

In Sajdaĥ and \\nQa’daĥ, they should draw their feet out towards the right side. \\nIn Qa’daĥ, they should sit on their left buttock. They should place \\ntheir right and left hands on the middle of their right and left thighs \\nrespectively. The rest method is like that of men.
